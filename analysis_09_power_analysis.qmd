# Power analysis {#sec-analysis-power-analysis}

The current course only provides a basic introduction to power analysis. Package `pwr` offers power analysis for, among others, t tests, proportion tests and chi squared tests. **The usage of package `pwr` is not exam material.**

Calculate power for a two sample t-test with a given sample size (n = 30) and effect size (Cohen's d = 0.5):

```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(n = 30, d = 0.5, sig.level = .05, type = "two.sample",
           alternative = "two.sided")
```

If we want to know what sample size is required for detecting an effect size of d = 0.8 with 80% power, we omit n from the arguments:

```{r}
pwr.t.test(d = 0.3, power = 0.8, sig.level = .05, type = "two.sample",
           alternative = "two.sided")
```
